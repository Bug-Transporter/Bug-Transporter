## 📖 Group Information

### Group Name
**Bug Transporters** (Official identifier: **AAE5303_Team**)

### Why This Name?
We chose **Bug Transporters** because it perfectly captures the reality of working with ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04—where we spend half our time "transporting" error messages to Google. Officially, we are **AAE5303_Team**, representing our shared academic journey and our commitment to collaborative problem-solving (and shared debugging sessions).
